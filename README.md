Breast Cancer Data Analysis and Streamlit App
Overview
This project involves analyzing the Breast Cancer dataset using machine learning techniques and creating an interactive web application with Streamlit. The project includes data preprocessing, feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, and building an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for predictions.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Loading and cleaning the Breast Cancer dataset.
Feature Selection: Using SelectKBest for selecting the most significant features.
Model Tuning: Optimizing an ANN (MLPClassifier) using Grid Search CV.
Interactive Web App: A Streamlit app for dataset interaction and viewing model predictions.
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8 or above
Virtual environment tools (venv or virtualenv)
Streamlit
